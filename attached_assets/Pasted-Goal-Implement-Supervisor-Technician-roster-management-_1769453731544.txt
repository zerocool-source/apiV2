Goal: Implement Supervisor → Technician roster management (NO regions yet). Add endpoints and RBAC.

Context:
- Backend: Fastify + Prisma + Postgres
- Auth already exists with JWT + roles.
- Current API roles: "supervisor", "tech", "repair" (and maybe "admin" but treat repair_foreman as admin later).
- App roles are irrelevant here; this is backend only.

Requirements:

1) Prisma schema updates
- Ensure TechnicianProfile has:
  - supervisorId String? (nullable) referencing User.id of the supervisor
  - active Boolean default true
- If these fields already exist, do NOT duplicate them. Just use them.

2) New Endpoints

A) GET /api/technicians
- Auth required.
- If role === "supervisor": return only technicians whose technicianProfile.supervisorId === currentUserId AND active === true (include inactive too if query param ?includeInactive=true).
- If role === "repair" (repair foreman/admin equivalent): return all technicians (allow includeInactive).
- If role === "tech": return only their own profile (or 403; choose “return self only” to keep it useful).

Return fields:
- user: { id, email, role }
- technicianProfile: { id, userId, name, phone, truckId, active, supervisorId }

B) PATCH /api/technicians/:id
- Auth required.
- Allows updating ONLY:
  - supervisorId (String or null)
  - active (Boolean)
  - name/phone/truckId (optional, OK)

RBAC rules:
- supervisor:
  - can PATCH only technicians that currently belong to them (supervisorId == currentUserId)
  - can also PATCH technicians that are currently unassigned (supervisorId is null) ONLY to claim them (set supervisorId=currentUserId)
  - cannot assign a tech to a different supervisorId (except themselves) -> 403
- repair (admin equivalent):
  - can PATCH any technician with any supervisorId/active changes
- tech:
  - can PATCH only themselves, and only name/phone/truckId (no supervisorId/active)

3) Assignment creation protection (important)
Update POST /api/assignments so:
- supervisor can only create assignments for techs that belong to them (techProfile.supervisorId == supervisorUserId)
- repair role can create for anyone
- tech cannot create assignments (403)

4) Seed update (optional but helpful)
- Ensure seed creates:
  - 1 supervisor user
  - 2-3 tech users linked to that supervisor via technicianProfile.supervisorId
  - Tech profiles active=true
If seed already exists, just update it minimally.

5) Add curl test commands into a comment block in README or replit.md:
- login as supervisor
- GET /api/technicians
- PATCH to deactivate a tech
- PATCH to claim an unassigned tech
- POST /api/assignments (success for own tech, 403 for someone else)

Deliverables:
- Code changes committed in the repo
- Build passes
- Routes return correct 401/403 responses
