755195,Comment 3-phase Electrical Conversion,"The sub-panel in the equipment room currently receives three-phase power, and the proposal includes converting the existing single-phase motors to three-phase motors. This conversion is recommended for enhanced efficiency, as three-phase motors are inherently more energy-efficient than single-phase motors under the same load. Three-phase motors can turn the same volume of water at a lower pump speed, reducing friction and energy consumption. Additionally, they have a lower upfront cost, as they do not require capacitors, and they draw a steady, constant power stream, leading to more stable and reduced energy usage.

For comparison, think of a single-cylinder engine versus a three-cylinder engine—three-phase motors operate with higher efficiency, typically within a 75% to 95% range. The proposed work includes replacing breakers, installing contactors and a contactor box, replacing corroded timeclocks, and updating the wiring, conduit, plugs, and covers. Converting the motors from single-phase to three-phase will optimize the system’s energy efficiency, reduce operating costs, and ensure a robust and reliable setup aligned with the facility's three-phase power supply.",,,Product,0.00,0.00,N/A,Active,No,,2025-09-30T12:03:34,2025-11-17T11:41:23
755196,Comment Equipment Room Ventilation,"The proposal is to install a ventilation fan in the equipment room to ensure the heaters receive proper airflow, as they require an appropriate gas-to-air ratio for optimal operation. We will install a wall-mounted, high-speed commercial-grade fan that will efficiently exhaust air from the room. This fan will also help vent any corrosive fumes from the chemicals stored in the area, thereby prolonging the longevity of the equipment. To further enhance safety, we have taken proactive steps by installing fume suppressor plugs to reduce the release of chlorine and acid fumes from the containers. The ventilation fan will push fumes out while pulling in fresh air, and we recommend this solution for every equipment room to maintain a safe and efficient environment.",,,Product,0.00,0.00,N/A,Active,No,,2025-09-30T12:03:35,2025-11-17T11:41:23
755197,Comment Heater Venting Replacement,"The heater venting has been reported as rusted. The proposal is to replace the damaged and rusted venting to ensure safe operations. Improper ventilation can lead to internal damage to the heaters due to recirculating contaminated air. Heaters require a specific gas-to-air ratio during operation, and rusted venting increases the risk of the pipes developing holes, which could leak flue gases into the equipment area, creating hazardous conditions.

Carbon monoxide (CO) is particularly concerning, as it is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, and non-irritating gas that can be lethal, often referred to as the “silent killer.” If early signs of CO poisoning, such as fatigue, headaches, confusion, and dizziness, are ignored, individuals may lose consciousness and be unable to escape the danger. CO binds to hemoglobin in the blood, reducing its ability to carry oxygen, which interferes with oxygen delivery to the body's organs.

This repair is necessary to ensure that the heaters operate properly according to the manufacturer's recommendations, thereby safeguarding the health and safety of all users. Addressing the venting issue promptly will help prevent potential hazards and ensure effective heater performance.",,,Product,0.00,0.00,N/A,Active,No,,2025-09-30T12:03:36,2025-11-17T11:41:25
755198,Comment Pool Tile Cleaning/Calcium Removal,"The proposal includes performing a comprehensive calcium removal service along the waterline tiles of pool. Over time, calcium and mineral deposits accumulate at the waterline as a result of evaporation and chemical fluctuations in the water. This leads to the formation of hard, white scale along tile surfaces and around metal fixtures such as handrails. If not addressed, these deposits can etch or stain the tile surface, degrade grout, and compromise the appearance and longevity of the finish.

To carry out this service properly, the water level will be lowered approximately 6–12 inches below the skimmers to fully expose the affected tile areas and allow unobstructed access. Industry-approved techniques such as low-pressure media blasting or the use of safe, specialized descaling solutions will be employed to remove calcium buildup without damaging the tile or surrounding finishes. The handrails at the waterline will also be cleaned to eliminate scale accumulation.

After the removal process, the area will be thoroughly vacuumed to eliminate loose debris, and a commercial-grade tile sealant will be applied to the cleaned surfaces. This sealant creates a protective barrier to help prevent future mineral buildup, enhance resistance to staining, and make routine maintenance easier and more effective. Once sealed, the pool area must remain closed for a full 24-hour curing period to ensure the sealant sets properly.

Following the cure time, the pool will be refilled to the proper level, water chemistry will be tested and rebalanced, and the pool area will be reopened for use.

755205,Drain pool glass removal,"REMOVING THE GLASS VIA DRAINING
First, We close the pool or spa immediately to patrons. Before draining any body of water, We need to address the local water table to ensure that the shell will not succumb to hydrostatic pressure. (NOTE YOUR INSURANCE COMPANY OR BREAKPOINT MAY NEED YOU TO SIGN A RELEASE WAVER RELEASING THEM/US FROM LIABILITY WE VERY RARELEY RECOMEND DRAINING POOLS.)

We turn off Pool Circulation system off. 

Drain The Water using a sump pump rather than the main drain so that none of the water enters the pool’s circulation system. For a spa, the volume of water is likely so small that it is much more efficient and cost effective to drain the spa. 

Let Everything Dry. If we draining the body of water we wait until it completely dries out. Puddles on the floor can hide the glass shards and prevent proper removal.

We do a thorough sweep multiple times to make sure we get all of the larger glass shards up. 

Once the major shards are swept up, it’s time to get all of the small slivers with a shop vac. We use a uniform system when vacuuming the pool so we don’t miss anything. Once completely swept and vacuumed, We start refilling the water, balancing its chemistry, and opening.",,,Service,0.00,1500.00,N/A,Active,No,,2025-09-30T12:03:42,2025-11-17T11:41:32

755538,DE Filter Cleaning Large,"DE Filter Cleaning Procedure:
To maintain the efficiency and functionality of the diatomaceous earth (DE) filter, we will remove the cartridges or grids, thoroughly pressure-wash them to eliminate built-up debris, oils, and residual DE powder, and then reassemble the filter. Once the components are cleaned and securely reinstalled, fresh DE powder will be added to coat the grids, enabling the filter to effectively trap fine particles and maintain water clarity. This process is essential for restoring the filter’s efficiency, reducing system pressure, and ensuring proper water circulation. Regular maintenance of the DE filter prevents poor water quality, minimizes strain on the pump, and extends the lifespan of the filter components. By performing this service, the pool will remain compliant with health and safety regulations, providing clear, safe, and healthy water for users.",Filters,,Service,0.00,250.00,N/A,Active,No,,2025-09-30T12:15:14,2025-11-17T11:54:07

755608,Heater Bypass Comment,"We currently have no way of measuring the flow rate going into each pool heater, which is crucial for ensuring they operate properly according to the manufacturer's recommendations. As heaters age, they become increasingly sensitive to flow, leading to error codes that can halt operations.

The proposal is to install a FlowVis and bypass for each heater, along with additional plumbing to restore system functionality. This repair is necessary to prevent more costly issues down the line. Excessive flow can strip the copper in the heat exchanger, while insufficient flow can cause excessive soot buildup, leading to premature heater failure. Implementing this solution will help maintain optimal performance and extend the lifespan of the equipment.",,,Product,0.00,0.00,N/A,Active,No,,2025-09-30T12:17:48,2025-11-17T11:57:03
755611,Heater Venting Missing/Absent Comment,"The heater venting has been reported as absent, significantly increasing the risk of internal damage to the heaters due to recirculating contaminated air. Heaters require a specific gas-to-air ratio during operation, and the lack of proper venting can lead to hazardous conditions, including elevated carbon monoxide (CO) levels in the room. Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, and non-irritating gas that can be lethal, often referred to as the “silent killer.” If early signs of CO poisoning, such as fatigue, headaches, confusion, and dizziness, are ignored, individuals may lose consciousness and be unable to escape the danger. CO binds to hemoglobin in the blood, reducing its ability to carry oxygen, which interferes with oxygen delivery to the body’s organs.

The proposal is to deliver and install proper venting for the heater to ensure safe operations. This repair is essential for compliance with the manufacturer's recommendations and to safeguard the health and safety of all users. Implementing this solution will help prevent potential hazards and ensure the heaters operate effectively.",,,Product,0.00,0.00,N/A,Active,No,,2025-09-30T12:17:50,2025-11-17T11:57:05

755787,IPS Comment,"The body of water currently lacks an automatic system to detect chemical deficiencies and inject necessary sanitizing chemicals. We must rely on anticipating future usage and consumption rates while manually adjusting slow-erosion and slow-feed chemical feeders, which is nearly impossible to maintain throughout the day in smaller bodies of water. Furthermore, recent tightening of chemical parameters set by the Department of Health has led to closures at accounts without chemical controllers across the Inland Empire.

To achieve a more consistent chemical balance, we propose installing chemical controllers (IPS M920ca) that can detect imbalances and automatically inject required chemicals, such as chlorine or acid. These controllers maintain safe and accurate chemical levels within the water, helping to preserve equipment and plaster, maintain water quality, and ensure the safety of bathers. They can reduce chemical costs by up to 30%, effectively paying for themselves within five years.

The price includes the chemical controller, ORP and pH probes, flow cell, flow switch, and mounting board. With many years of experience using these controllers, we are confident in their reliability and longevity. They come with a five-year factory warranty on electronics and a one-year warranty on the chemical probes, flow cell, and flow switch, along with local factory support. These Wi-Fi-enabled controllers can comply with the new ""every day"" testing mandates from the Department of Environmental Health as outlined in Title 22, Chapter 20, Section 65523. They can check chemical parameters as required by Health Department authorities, log data, and alert the pool service company of any irregularities.",,,Product,0.00,0.00,N/A,Active,No,,2025-09-30T12:24:13,2025-11-17T12:03:57

755796,Mastic Comment,"This proposal includes the removal and replacement of the deteriorated mastic (Deck-O-Seal) located in the immediate expansion joints surrounding the bodies of water on site. The existing rubberized sealant in these areas has begun to crack and separate, compromising its ability to accommodate normal expansion and contraction between the pool shell and surrounding decking. Maintaining a watertight seal at these critical joints is essential to prevent water intrusion beneath the deck, which can lead to subgrade erosion, deck movement, or structural damage to the bodies.

The scope of work includes removing the existing mastic, cleaning and preparing the expansion joints, and applying new grey rubberized mastic with a light sand finish for a clean, grouted appearance unless otherwise specified.

Please note that this proposal specifically addresses only the mastic immediately bordering the pool, spa, or other water features. Radiating or decorative deck joints outside these areas are typically aesthetic in nature and not included in this scope. If desired, a separate estimate can be provided to address those additional joints.

This work ensures the functional integrity of the waterline expansion joints while maintaining compliance with standard pool construction and maintenance practices.

771909,Comment Fountain Tile Cleaning Mineral Blast Comment,"Proposal submitted for fountain mineral blast procedures. Over time, calcium and mineral deposits naturally accumulate along the tile surfaces of water features due to evaporation and fluctuations in water chemistry. These deposits form hard, white scale that can etch or stain tile surfaces, deteriorate grout, and diminish the overall appearance and lifespan of the finish if not properly maintained.

To address this, the water level will be lowered as needed to fully expose the affected tile areas, allowing safe and unobstructed access for cleaning. Industry-approved low-pressure media blasting and/or specialized descaling solutions will be used to remove calcium buildup effectively without damaging the tile or adjacent finishes. Any exposed waterline surfaces will also be cleaned to remove accumulated mineral scale.

Upon completion, all debris will be vacuumed and removed from the fountain basins. A commercial-grade tile sealant will then be applied to protect the cleaned surfaces, reducing future mineral buildup, improving stain resistance, and simplifying ongoing maintenance. The fountain will remain closed for a minimum 24-hour curing period to ensure the sealant sets properly before refilling and returning the feature to normal operation.

This preventive service enhances both the appearance and longevity of the fountain finishes while supporting community presentation standards and maintaining safe, attractive amenities for residents and guests.",,,Product,0.00,0.00,N/A,Active,Yes,,2025-10-29T05:11:49,2025-11-17T11:41:24
